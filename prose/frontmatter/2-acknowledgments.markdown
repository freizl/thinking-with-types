## Acknowledgments {-}

This book couldn't have happened without the support of many, many fantastic
people. I'd like to thank everyone for their support, their patronage and their
enthusiasm. Some of the exceptionally instrumental people, however, require
further accolades. In particular:

*Fintan Halpenny,* for his everlasting gusto. My unofficial editor,
publicist, and second pair of eyes. The only person I know who's actually done
all of the exercises.

*Irene Papakonstantinou,* for her untiring support, who first encouraged me
to publish this book, who bullied me into staying on schedule, and for putting
her money where her mouth was.

*Jessie Natasha,* for patiently answering my non-stop design questions. For
time and time again offering me her sense of style, and spending long hours with
me helping make the book look as good as it does.

*Anushervon Saidmuradov,* whose support for me greatly exceeds his interest
in Haskell.

Furthermore, this book wouldn't have been possible without the financial support
of *Habito*, *Mirzhan Irkegulov*, *Michael Koloberdin*,
and *Chris Double*.
